# Place Picker

## Project Overview

**Place Picker** is a web application designed to help users explore and select various travel destinations. It leverages React's modern hooks, including `useEffect`, to manage component lifecycle events and state, ensuring a dynamic and responsive user experience.

## Key Features

- **React Hooks**: The project makes extensive use of `useEffect` to handle side effects, such as fetching data or performing operations based on dependencies.
- **Responsive UI**: A clean and responsive user interface that adapts to different screen sizes, providing an optimal user experience on both mobile and desktop devices.
- **Modular Components**: The application is built with a modular approach, breaking down the UI into reusable components such as `Places`, `Modal`, `ProgressBar`, and `DeleteConfirmation`.
- **Dynamic Data Handling**: Integration of dynamic data sources to populate the UI with relevant content, showcasing the flexibility of React's state and effect management.

## Project Structure

- **`src/`**: Contains the main source code for the application.

  - **`App.jsx`**: The main component that houses the core logic of the application.
  - **`components/`**: A directory containing reusable UI components like `Places`, `Modal`, `ProgressBar`, and `DeleteConfirmation`.
  - **`assets/`**: Houses image files and other static resources used within the application.
